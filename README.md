# Xtank Refresh
  - Have you heard of the games [Tank (1990, NES)](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_1412-NES.php) or [XTank Online](https://toucharcade.com/games/xtank-online)? This Java project is a game based on those ideas. It uses the SWT graphics libraries and many Java packages in order to create a LAN multiplayer game where players could compete by trying to be the last surviving tank. Some features include the ability to select specific tank types and an intuitive UI.

  - Graphics Library used: SWT
  - Developed and tested on Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit
  - Instructions to run it on the console are provided in "ExecutableJAR".

  - Expand the game window so you can see and read everything!
