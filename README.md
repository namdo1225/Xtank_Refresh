# Xtank_Refresh

NOTE
  - Graphics Library used: SWT
  - Developed and tested on Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit
  - Do not spam the spacebar/shoot key! Some computers cannot handle large amount of inputs from server/client with key spamming and will boot you out of the game.
  - When inputting the IP address/port number, please do not enter a large number since your address and ports are validated using an int. You could cause a crash if you enter a number over int's limit.
  - Please import Xtank_Refresh/A3_Xtank_SWT into and run it on Eclipse. All external dependencies for SWT are imported easily in Eclipse. We do not know how to run the game in a command console. Run the XTank.java - main() method.
  - Winners are updated on the player/client screen after playing a game. Click the update winner button in the title/menu screen after playing a player has won a game.
  - Expand the game window so you can see and read everything!
