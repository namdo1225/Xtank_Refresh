# A3_Xtank

NOTE
  - Final branch for grading: main
  - Graphics Library used: SWT
  - Developed and tested on Windows 10 and 11, 64-bit
  - Do not spam the spacebar/shoot key! Some computers cannot handle large amount of inputs from server/client with key spamming and will boot you out of the game.
  - When inputting the IP address/port number, please do not enter a large number since your address and ports are validated using an int. You could cause a crash if you enter a number over int's limit.
  - Please import A3_Xtank/A3_Xtank_SWT into and run it on Eclipse. All external dependencies for SWT are imported easily in Eclipse. We do not know how to run the game in a command console. Run the XTank.java - main() method.
  
CONTROLS
  - Spacebar: shoot
  - Arrow keys (UP/DOWN): move forward/backward
  - Arrow keys (LEFT/RIGHT): rotate tank
